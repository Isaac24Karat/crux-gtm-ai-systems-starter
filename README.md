# Crux GTM + AI Systems Starter (Month-1 Slice)

**What this shows (3-min):**  
Intake → JSON Schema Validation → Enrichment → Smart Routing → AI Scoring (v1 stub) → ROI/Health snapshot.

## Why this matters
- **Data you can trust**: validation at the edge (JSON Schema) before CRM write.
- **Faster ops**: automated routing + alerting, less manual triage.
- **Visibility**: early attribution + health checks to de-risk growth.

## Repo map
- `/schemas` – JSON Schemas for lead intake + doc-package completeness.
- `/flows` – n8n flow (placeholder) describing the Month-1 orchestration.
- `/dashboards` – KPIs overview and example metrics.
- `/runbooks` – Month-1 roll-out + data health SOPs.

## 30/60/90 (short)
- **30d**: validated intake, hygiene dashboards, routing SLA.
- **60d**: doc-package integrity (checklists + queues), attribution v2.
- **90d**: forecasting v1, governance, health checks.
